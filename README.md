# Requirements
TBD

# Running the server
You need to set a few environment variables first:

*  `export FLASK_APP=brainz.py`
*  `export FLASK_DEBUG=1`

Then start flask:

`flask run --host=<your local IP address>`

The app will start-up and you should be able to load the controller by pointing a browser at 

	http://<your local IP address>:5000/
